indeed , I fear
Valentine will have no g r eater pleasure than that of fulﬁlling her

quarter, I assure you
”
In that case replied Franz , as I shall raise none , you may make
arrangements when you please ; I have pledged my wo r d , and shall feel

pleasure and happiness in adhering to it
”
Then said Villefort, nothing further is required ; the contract was
to have been signed three days since : we S hall ﬁnd it all ready , and can
”
Sign it to day

But the mourning ? said Franz , hesitating
”
Fear not , replied Villefort ; no ceremony will be neglected in my
house Mademoiselle de Villefort may retire during the prescribed three
months to her estate of S aint -M é ran ; I say he r s , for she inherits it
to -day There , in a week , if you like , the civil marri age Shall be cele

Madame de S aint -M é ran wi shed
her daughter should be ma r ried there When that is over , you , sir can

Madame de Villefort would not believe it , and Valentine was thunde r
struck S he looked round for help and would have gone down to
’
her g ra ndfather s room , but meeting Villefort on the stai r s , he took
he r a r m and led her into the drawing -room In the anteroom , Valen
tine met Barrois , and looked despai r ingly at the old se r vant One
moment after , Madame de Villefort entered the dr awing-room with he r
little E dward
It was evident that she had shared the g r ief of the
family, for she was pale and looked fatigued
S he sat down , took
Edward on he r knees , and from time to time pressed almost c onvul
si ve l y to he r b osom this child , on whom her affections appeared centered
one was th e
T WO ca r riages were soon hea r d to ente r the courtya r d
nota r y s ; the other , that of F r anz and his f r iends In a moment the
whole party wa s assembled Valentine was so pale one might trace the
b lue veins f r om her temples , round her eyes and down her cheeks F r anz
was deeply aff ected Ch ateau-R enaud and Albe r t looked at each other
with amazement ; the ce remony which was j ust concluded had no t
appeared more so r rowful than did that which wa s commencing Ma d ame
de Villefort had placed he r self in the shade behind a velvet cu r tain ; and
as sh e constantly bent over he r child , it was diffic ul t to read the exp r es
sion of her face Vi llefort was , as usual , unmoved
The notary , after having , acco r ding to the customary method
arr anged the papers on the table taken his place in an a rm-chair, and
f
raised his spectacles , turned toward Franz:
“
’
Are you M Franz de Q uesnel , b a rofr d Epinay I asked he , although
he knew it pe rf ectly
”
Yes , sir , said Franz The notary bowed
I have , then , to inform you , sir, at the request of M de Villefort
that your proj ected marriage with Mademoisell e de Villefort has changed
the feeling of M Noirt ie r toward his grandchil d and that he di sinherits
he r entirely of the fortune he would have left her Let me hasten to
add , continued he , that the testator, having only the right to alienate
a pa r t of his fortune and having alienated it all , th ejwill will not bea r
”
sc r utiny and is declared null and void
Y e s, said Villefo r t ;
but I warn M d E pinay, that during my life
’
time my father s will shall never be scrutinized , my position forbidding
”
any doubt to be entertained
”
S i r , said F r anz
I regret much such a question has been raised in
the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine ; I have never inquired the
amount of he r fo rtune , whic h , however limited it may be , exceeds mine
My father has sought consideration in this alliance with M de Villefort ;

When Franz had ﬁnished rea di ng this account , so dreadful for a

the elder had returned to h is ser

but at the gaming-table of the baths of Lucca , of which
he was one of the most assiduous cour tiers It need not be
said that he had carried with him every farthing that had been allowed
for his j ourney and as a reward for the maj estic and solemn manner in
which h e had maintained his characte r of father
Andrea at his d e part i n e inherited all the papers which proved
that he had indeed the honor of being the son of the M arquis Bartolo
meo Cavalcanti and the March ioness Oliva Corsinari He was now
fairly launc h e d i n that Parisian society which gives such ready access
to foreigners and treats them not as what they reall y are , but as what
they wish to be con sidered B esides what is required of a young man
in Paris f —to speak its language tolerably, to make a good appea r ance ,
to be a good ca r d -playe r , and pay in cash They a r e certainly less par
t ic ul ar with a foreigner than with a Frenchman
Andr ea had , then , in
a fortnight , attained a very fai r position He was entitled M l e Comte ;

immense riches buried in the qua r r ies of Sa ra v e zza we r e a constant

gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful , but which
now assumed the garb of reality
S uch was the state of society in Pa r is at the pe r iod we bring before
our r eaders , when Monte -Cr isto went one evening to pay D anglars a
visit Danglars was out but the count wa s asked to go and se e the
baroness and he accepted the invitation It was never without a ne r v

it , that Madame Danglars he ard Monte -Cristo s name announced

Monte -Cristo cast one rapid and curious glance round this sanctum ;
it was the ﬁrst time he had ever seen Mademoiselle d A rmilly, of whom
he had heard much
”
We ll ! said the banker to his daughter , are we then all to be
excluded
He then led the young man into the study, and , either by chance or
manoeu vre , the door was partially closed after Andrea , so that from the
place where they sat neither the count nor the baroness could se e any
thing ; but as the banker had accompanie d Andrea , Madame D anglars
appeared to take no notice of it
The count soon heard Andrea s voice , singing a Corsican song
accompanied by the piano
While the count smiled at hearing this
song which made him lose sight of Andrea in the recollection of Bene
’
detto Madame Danglars was boasting to Monte Cristo of her husband s
strength of mind , wh o that very morning had lost three or four hundred
thousand francs by a failure at Milan The praise wa s well deserved
for had not the count heard it from the baroness , or by one of those
’
means by which he knew everyt hing , the baron s countenance would
not have led him to suspect it
Hem ! thought Monte -Cr isto , he begins to conceal his losses ; a
”
month since he boasted of them
Then aloud ,
Oh ! madame M D anglars is so skillful he will soon
regain at the Bourse what he loses elsewh ere
”
I se e you are maintaining an erroneous idea as well as many more ,
said Madame D angla r s
Wh at is it 2 said Monte -Cristo
”
That M Danglars speculates , whereas he never does so
Truly , madame , I recollect M Debray told me
apropos , what has

beco me of him ? I have seen nothing of him the last three or four days
”
N or I , sa id Madame D anglars ; but you began a sentence Sir, and

Wh ich
M Debray ha d t old you
Truly, he told me it wa s you who sacr iﬁced t o the demon of speen

”
I was once very fond of it but I am not so now
Then you are wrong, madame Fo r tune is precarious ; and if I were
’
a woman , and fate had made me a banker s wife whatever might be my
conﬁdence in my husban d s good fortune , still , in speculation you know ,
there is great risk Well ! I would secure for myself a fo r tune inde

rude that Madame Danglars blushed

You were not of the party M de M o rc e rf

Prince Cavalcanti said Danglars , wh o persisted in gi ving the young
man that title
Pardon me said Al ber t, I was not aware he wa s a p rince And
Prince Cavalcanti sang wi th Mademoiselle Eug e nie yesterday ! It must
have been charming indeed I regret not having heard them But I
was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accomp any

M a ﬁ nI my dear viscount , you are fated to hea r music this eve ni ng ;

you have only escap e d from the piano of Mademoisell e D anglars to be
”
attacked by the guzla of Hayd e e
Haydé e ! what an adorable name ! A r e there then , really women
”
who he ar the name of Hayd e e any where but in By r on s poems ?
Hayd e e is a very uncommon name in F r ance
Certainly there are
but it is common enough in A l bania and Epi r us ; it is as if you said , for
example , Chastity, Modesty Innocence — it is a kind of baptismal name ,
”
as you Parisian s call it
”
Oh, that is charming ! said Albert ;
how I should like to hear my
country women called Mademoiselle Goodness , Mademoiselle S ilence
M ademoiselle Christian Charity ! Only think , then , if Mademoiselle
Danglars , instead of being called Claire Marie E ug e nie , had been
named Mademoiselle Ch astity Modesty Innocence D anglars ; what a

”
Come , you are j oking yourself now ; are there slaves now ad ays ?
”
U ndoubtedly , as Hayd e e is mine
R eally, count, you do nothing, and have nothing like other people
The slave of M l e Comte de Monte -Cristo ! why, it is a rank of itself in
France ; and from the way in which you lavish money, it is a place that
”
must be worth a hundred thousand francs a year
A hun d red thousand francs the poor girl originally possessed much

You are right , and one of the greatest in her country , too

How was it that Dionysius the Tyrant became a school -master

The fortune of war, my dear viscount , the caprice of fort une

For the world it is ; but not for you , my dear viscount , who are one

What is his name ?
Viscount Albert ; it is the same whom I re scued from the hands of

In what language would you like me to converse with him ?

M onte Cristo turned to Albert
Do you know modern Greek ?
asked he
”
Alas no , said Albert ; nor even ancient Greek , my dear count ;
never had Homer or Plato a poorer or more scornful scholar than
”
myself
”
Then , said Hayd e e , proving by her remark that she had quite
’
understood Mo nte Cristo s question and Albert s answer , then I will

speak either in French or Italian , if my lord so will s it
”
Monte Cristo reﬂected one instant
You will speak in Itali an ,
said he
Then , turning toward A l bert
It is a pity you do not understand
either ancient or modern Greek , both of which Hayd e e speaks so ﬂuently ;
the poor child will be obliged to talk to you in Italian , which will give
”
you but a very false idea of her powers of conversation
The count made a sign to Hayd e e to address his visitor

small tables appropriated to that purpose

My dear host , and you, signora , said Albert, in Italian , excuse my
apparent stupi dity I am quite bewildered , and it is natural that it
should be so Here I am in the heart of Paris ; but a moment ago I
heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bell s of
the lemonade sell ers , a nd now I am transported to the E ast ; not such
as I have seen it , but suc h as my dreams have painted it Oh ! signora ,
if I could but speak Greek , your conversation , added to the fairy
scene which surrounds me , would fur nish an evening that I could never

I speak su icient Italian to converse with you , sir, said Hayd e e ,
quietly ; and if you like what is Eastern , I will do my best to make you

On what subj ect shall I converse with her ? said Albert , in a low
tone to Monte -Cristo
Just what you please ; her country , her youthful reminiscences ;

or, if you like it better , you can talk of R ome , N aples , or Florence
Oh ! said Albert , it is of no use to be in the company of a Greek

sadness clouded her beaut iful brow
”
What are you saying to her ? said M orc e rf, in an undertone
I again reminded her that you were a friend , and that she need not
conceal anything from you
”
Then , said Albert this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the priso ners
was your ﬁrst remembrance what is the next ?
Oh ! t h e n I remember sitting under the shade of some sycamo r e
t r ees , on the borders of a lake , in the waters of which the trembling
foliage was reﬂected as in a mirror U nder the oldest and thickest of
these trees , reclini ng on cushion s , sat my father ; my mother was at his
feet , and I , ch ildlike , amused myself by playi ng with his long, white beard ,
which descended to hi s girdle , or with the diamond hilt of the c imeter
attached to his girdl e Then , from time to time , there came to him an
Albanian , who s aid something , to which I paid no attention , but which
’
’
he al ways answered in the same tone of voice , eithe r Kill , or Pardon
”
It is very strange , said Albert , to hear such words from the mouth
of any but an actress on the stage ; and one nee d s to be saying to one s
’
self, This is no ﬁc tion, in order to believe it And how does France
appear in your eyes , accustomed as they have been to gaze on such
”
enchanted scenes ?
”
I think it is a ﬁne country, said Hayd e e , but I se e France as it
really is , because I se e it with the eyes of a woman ; whereas my own
country, which I sa w with the eyes of a child is enveloped in an atmos
h
p e re , lumi nous or otherwise , according as my remembrances of it are
s a d or j oyous ”

Well ! I was but four years old , when one night I wa s suddenly
awoke by my mothe r We were in the palace of Jani na ; she snatched
me f r om the cushions on which I was sleeping and on opening my eyes
I saw hers were ﬁlled with tears S he took me away without speaking
’
When I sa w her weeping I began to cry too
S ilence , child ! said she
At other times , in spite of maternal endearments o r threats , I had with
a child s caprice , been accustomed to continue to my ; but on this occa
sion there was an intonation of such extreme te rror in my mothe r s voice
that I ceased at once S he bo r e me rapidl y away I saw then th a t we
were descending a large staircase ; around us all my mother s se r vants
carrying trunks , bags , ornaments , j ewels , purses of gold , we r e hur rying
away in the greatest dist r action Behin d the women came a gua r d of
twenty men , armed with long guns and pistols , and dressed in the c os
tume which the Greeks have assumed since they have again become a
nation You may imagi ne there was something start li ng and ominous ,
said Hayd e e , shaking her head , and turning pale at the mere remem
b r ance of the scene , in this long ﬁl e of slaves and women only half
aroused from sleep , or at least , so they appeared to me , wh o wa s myself
scarcely awake Here and there , on the wall s of the stai r case , were
reﬂected gigantic shadows , which trembled in the li ght of the pine
”
torches
said a voice at the end of the gallery This voice made
every one how before it , like the wind passing over a ﬁeld of corn As
for me , it made me tremble This voice was that of my father He
marched the last , clothed in his splendid robes , and holding in his hand
the carbine with which your emperor presented him , and leaning on
his favorite S elim , he drove us all before him , as a shepherd woul d his
”
straggling ﬂock My father, said Hayd e e , raising her head , wa s that
il lustrious man known in Europe under the name of A l i T e b e lin, pacha
”
of Janina , and before whom Turkey trembled
A l bert without knowi ng wh y, started on hearing these words pro
nounc e d with such a haughty and d igniﬁed accent ; it appeared to him as
if there was something supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the expres
sion which gleamed from the b r illiant eyes of Hayd e e at this moment ;
she appeared like a Pythoness evoking a specter , as she recalled to his
mind the remembrance of the fearful death of this man , to the news of
which all Europe had listened with horror
”
S oon , said Hayd e e , we halted on our march and found ou r selves
on the borders of a lake My mother pressed me to her throbbing heart
and, at the distance of a few paces , I saw my father, wh o was glancing
’
anxiously around Four marble steps led down to the water s e dge,
and below them was a boat ﬂoating From where we stood I could se e

It was indeed a ﬂight which my father was trying to e ff ect I have
been told since that the garrison of the castle of Janina , fatigued with
long service
Here Hayd e e cast a signiﬁcant glance at Monte -Cristo , whose eyes
had been riveted on her countenance during the whole course of her nar
The young girl then continued slowly, like a person who is eithe r
ra t ive
inventing or suppressing some feature of the history whi ch he is relating
”
You were saying, signora , said A l bert, who was paying the most
implicit attention to the recital , that the garri son of Janina , fatigued
with long service
Had treated with the S eraskier Kour eh id, who had been sent by the
sul tan to seize my father It wa s then that Ali T e b e lin took the resolu
tion of retiring after having sent to the sultan a French ofﬁcer in whom
he reposed great conﬁdence to the asylum which he had long before
p r epared for him self, and which he called Ka tap hyg ion, or the refuge
”
And this o fﬁcer , asked Albert , do you remember his name ,
sig nora
Monte -Cr isto exchanged a rapid glance with the young girl , which
wa s quite unperceived by Albert
”
N o , said she , I do not remember it j ust at this moment ; but if it
shoul d occur to me presently, I will tell you
Albert was on the point of pronouncing his father s name , when
Mon te -Cristo gently held up his ﬁnger in token of reproach ; the young
man recollected hi s vow, and was silent
It wa s toward this kiosk that we were rowing
A ground -ﬂ oo r
o rnamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the water and
another ﬂoor looking on the lake was all which was visible to the eye
But beneath the ground -ﬂ oor, stretching out into the island , wa s a large
subterraneous cavern , to which my mother , myself and the women
we r e conducted In this place were together
purses and 2 0 0
barrels ; the purses contained
of money in gold and the
barrels we r e ﬁlled with
pounds of gun -powder

As for me , I had been forgotten ; I ran toward him ; he saw me hold
out my arms to him , and he stooped down and pressed my forehead
with his lips Oh that kiss it was the last ; it is still on my forehead
On descendi ng , we distinguished through the lattice -work several boats
which were gradually becoming more di stinct At ﬁrst they were like
black specks , they now looked like birds skimming the sur face of the
waves Dur ing this time , in the kiosk , at the feet of my father , were
seated twenty Palicares , concealed from view by an angle of the wall , and
watching with eager eyes the arrival of the boats , and hol di ng, ready
their long guns inl aid with mother-of-pearl and silver Cartridges in
great numbers were l ying scattered on the ﬂoor ; my father looked at his
watch , and paced up and down in anguish This was the scene which
presented itself when I quitted my father after that la st kiss
M y mother and I traversed the passage to the tavern S e l im was
stil l at his post, and smil ed sadly on us We fetched our cushions from
the other e nd of the tavern , and sat down by S elim In great dangers
the devoted ones cli ng to each other ; and , young as I was, I quite
understood that some i mminent danger was hanging over our heads
Albert had often h eard , not from his father , for he never spoke on
the subj ect , but from strangers , the description of the last moments of
the vizier of Janina ; he had read di ff erent accounts of his death , but
this history seemed to borrow new life from the voice and expression
of the young girl ; this living accent and melancholy expression at once
charmed and horriﬁed him
A s to Hayd e e , at these terrible reminiscences , sh e ceased speaking
her head leaning on her hand like a ﬂower in a storm and her eyes
g azing on vac ancy , seemed still to se e the green summit of Pindus , and
the blue waters of the L ake of Janin a, a magic mirror , reﬂecting the
somber picture which sh e sketched Monte -Cristo looked at her with
an in desc ribable expression of interest and pity

And he renewed the ﬂame of his lance with an alacrity which
reminded one of a Dionysius of ol d Crete But I , wh o was only a little

one who had seen the magistrate at this moment would have
supposed that he had anticipated the blow ; it certainly never had
occurred to him that his father would carry candor, or rather rudeness
so far as to relate such a history In truth , Noirtie r, who never cared
for the Opinion of his son , had never explained the affair to Vill efo r t, so
that he had always believed that the General de Q uesnel , or the Baron
d Epinay, as he was styled , according as the speaker wished to use the
title he had won for h imself, or that conf erred by others , fell the victim
of assassination , and not that he wa s killed fai r ly in a duel This harsh
letter , from a young man generally so respectful , s truck a mortal blow
at the pride of Villefort
Hardl y had he read the letter, when his wife entered The departure
of Franz , when summoned by Noirtie r, had so much ast onl sh e d every

Franz was broken off This wa s an awkwa r d t hing to have to r eport to
those who we r e waiting S he , therefo r e , contented he r self with saying
that N o irtie r having, at the commencement of the di scussion , been
attacked by a sort of apoplectic ﬁt , the a d air would necessarily be
defe r red for some days longer Thi s ne ws , false as it was followed so
singularly in the train of the two similar misfortunes , that the audito r s
were as tonished and retired without a remark
D uring this time , Valentine at once terriﬁed and happy, after ha v
ing embraced and thanked the feeble old man for thus breaking , wi th a
single blow, the chain which she had conside r ed as indissoluble , asked
leave to retire to her own room , in o r der to recover her composur e
N o irtie r looked the permission which sh e solicited But instead of going
to her own room , Valentine , having once gained her liberty , ente r ed the
gallery, and opening a small door a t the end of it , found herself at once
in the garden
In the midst of all the strange events which had c r owded one on the
othe r , an inde ﬁnabl e sentiment of dread had taken possession of Valen
’
tine s mind S he expected every moment that sh e should se e Mo rr el
appea r , pale and t r embling to forbid the signing of the contract , like
”
the Lord of R avenswood in The Bride of Lamme r moor
It was high time for her to make her appearance at the gate fo r
M aximilian had long awaited her coming He had guessed what was
going on when he saw Franz quit the cemetery with Villefort He fol
lowed him , saw him enter , afterward go out , and then re e nter with
Albe r t and Ch a teau-R enaud He had no longer any doubt ; he the r e
fore quickly hid hi mself in the inclosure , prepared for all events , and
certain that Valentine woul d hasten to him the ﬁ r st moment she could
He wa s not mist aken ; his eye , peering through the woode n partition
soon dis cove r ed the young girl , who , throwing aside all h e r usual pre
cautions , walked a t once to the gate The ﬁr st glance which Maximilian
directed toward her entirely re -assured him ; the ﬁrst words she p r o
no unc e d made his heart bound with delight
We are saved
said Valentine
”
S aved ! repeated M orrel , not being able to conceive such inten se
”
happiness ; by whom ?
By my grandfather Oh, Mor r el ! pray love him well !
Mo r rel swore to love him with all his soul ; and at that moment he
could safely promise to do so fo r he was not content to love him me r ely
as a friend or even as a father , he worshiped him as a god
But tell me Valentine , how has it all been e ﬂ e c te d ? what st r ange
”
m eans has he used ?

Valentine was 0 1 1 t he point of relating all but she suddenly remem
bered that there was a ter r i ble secret which co ncerned othe r s as well as
her g r andfather , and she said
At some future time I will tell you all a b out it
”
But when will that be ?
”
When I am your wife
The conversation had now turned upon a topic that made Morrel
re ady to accede to anything
He wa s, therefore , satisﬁed with what he
had j ust heard , and which was enough for one day However, he would
not leave without the p r omise of seeing Valentine again the next night
Valenti ne promised all that Morrel required of her , a nd certainly it wa s
less di fﬁcult now for her to believe that she should marry Maximilian
than it was an hour ago to assure he r self that sh e should not ma r ry
Franz
During the time occupied by the interview we have just detailed ,
Madame de Villefort had gone to visit N oirtier The old man looked
at her with that stern and fo r bidding expression with which he wa s
accustomed to receive her
”
’
S ir , said sh e , it is superﬂuous for me to tell you that Valentine s
”
r
o
ﬂ
mar r iage is b oken
since it was here that the rupture took place
,
’
Noirtie r s countenance remained immovable
But one thing I do not think you are awa r e of that is that I have
always been opposed to this mar riage , and that it was entered into
”
e ntirely without my consent
Noirti e r regarded his daughter-in-law with the look of a man desir
ing an explanation
N ow that this marriage , which I kno w you so much disliked , is done
away with , I come to you on an errand whic h neither M de Vil lefo r t
”
nor Valentine could consistently undertake
’
Noirt ie r s eyes demanded the natu
r e of her mission
I come to entreat you sir,” continued Madame de Villefort, as the
o nly one who has the right inasmuch a s I am the only one who will
,
receive no beneﬁt I come to entreat you to restore , not your love ,
for that sh e ha s always possessed but your fortune to your grand
”
daughter
’
There wa s a doubtful expression in N oirt ie r s eyes ; he was evidently
trying to discover the motive of this proceeding, and he could not suc
c e e d in doing so
”
May I hope , sir, said Madame de Villefort , that your intentions
”
accord with my request ?
Noi rt ier made a sign that they did

S he then bowed to Noirt ie r and retired
f ul and happy
The next day Noirt ie r sent for the notary ; the ﬁrst wi ll wa s torn up
and a second made , in which he left the whole of his fo r tune to Valen
tine , ou condition that she should never be separated from him It was
then generally reported that Made oiselle de Villefort, the heiress of
the Marquis and Ma r chioness de S aint -M e ran , and restored to the good
gr a ces of her grandfather, would ul timately have an income of three
hundred thousand livres
Whilst the engagement was being broken at the house of Vill e
fort , M orc e rf had received the visit of Monte -Cristo , and to show his
regard for Danglars , he assumed his dress un iform of lieutenant -general
with all his orders , ordered his best horses , and drove to the R ue de la
Chausse e d A nt in
D anglars was balancing his monthly accounts , and
it was not the best time for ﬁnding him in good humor At the ﬁrst
sight of his old friend , Danglars assumed his maj estic air and settled
himself in his easy-chair
M orc e rf usually so formal , had assumed an a ﬂ ab l e and smi ling
manner , and feeling sure that the overture he was about to make woul d
be well received , he did not adopt any man oeuvres but went at once
straight to the point
”
Well , baron , said he , here I am at last ; some time has elapsed
”
since ou
r plan s were formed , a nd they are not yet e xecuted
M orc e rf paused at these words , to see the brow of D anglars cleared
of the cloud which he attributed to his silence ; but on the contrary
to his great surpri se it grew darker and more impassible
”
To what do you allude , M l e Comte ? said Danglars , as if he was
trying in vain to guess at the meaning of the general s words
”
Ah ! said M orc e rf ; I se e you are a stickler for form s my dear
sir , and you remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted
M a f oi I I beg your pardon , but as I have but one son, and it is the ﬁrst
time I have ever thought of marrying him , I am still serving my
”
apprenticeship , you know : come , I will do my duty
And M orc e rf, with a forced smile , rose and making a low bow to
Dangla r s , said
M le Baron I have the hono r Of asking of you the hand of

But D anglars , instead of recei ving this address in the favorable
manner which M orc e rf had expected , knit his brow, and wi thout invi t

M le Comte , it will be necessary to reﬂect before I give you an

sil ence ; but one thing at least is clear , whi c h is that you decline allying
”
yourself with my family
”
N o sir , said Dangla r s ; I merely suspend my decision , that is all
And do you really flatter yourse lf that I shall yield to all your
caprice s and quietly and humbly await the time of again being received
into your good graces ?
Then , M l e Comte if you will not wait , we must look upon these
proj ects as if they had never been ente r tain ed
The count bit his lips till the blood almost started , to prevent the
e b ull ition of anger which his proud and ir r itable temper sca r cely allowed
hi m to restrain ; unde r standing ho wever, that in the p r esent sta te of
things the laugh would decidedly be against him, he turned from the
door , toward which he had been directing his steps and again con
fronted the ba nker A cloud settled on his brow , evincing decided
anxiety and uneasiness , instead of the expression of o ff ended pride
which had lately reigned there
”
My dear Dangla r s , said M o rc e rf, we have been acquainted for
many years and consequently we ough t to make some allowance for
each other s failings You owe me an explanatio n and really it is but
fair that I should know what unfortunate circumstance has deprived
my son of your favor
It is no personal feeling to ward the V iscount , that is all I c a n sa y
”
sir, replied Danglars who resumed his insolent manner as soon as b e
perceived that M orc e rf w a s a little softened and calmed down
And toward whom do you he ar this personal ill -feeling then
said
M o rc e rf, turning pale with anger The expression of the count s face
had not remained unperceived by the banker ; he ﬁxed on him a look of
g r eater assurance than before , and said :
”
You wo uld thank me for not goi ng further into particulars
A trembling , caused by suppressed rage , shook the whole f r ame of
the count and making a violent e ff ort over himself he said
I have a right to insist 0 1 1 your giving me an explanation I s it
Madame de M orc e rf who has displeased you ? is it my fortune which
you ﬁnd insuffi cient ? is it because my opinions di ff er from yours
”
N othing of the kind , sir, repli ed Danglars ; if such had been the
case I only should have been to blame , inasmuch as I was aware of all
these things when I made the engagemen t N o , do not seek any longer
to discover the reason Let us a de pt the middle course namely, delay,
which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement There is no hu r ry
My daughter is only seventeen years old , and your son twenty-one
Wh ilst we wait ti me will be prog ressing , events will succeed each other
things which yesterday look obscure , appear but too clear to -morrow, and
sometimes the lapse of a day , will destroy the most c r uel calumnies

M le Comte , I told you that I considered it best to avoid all explan a

Then , sir , I am patiently to s ubmit to you r refusal ? ”
Painful for me above all ; ye s, more painful to me than to you , for I

And clenching his gloves with passion , he left the apa r tment
Danglars remarked that during the whole conversation M orce rf h ad

never once dared to ask if it was on his own , M orc e rf s, account that
Danglars recalled his word
That evening there was a long confe r ence between several f r iends ,
and Cavalcanti , wh o had remained in the drawing-room with the ladies
wa s the last to leave the house of the banker
The next morning di rectly he awoke , Danglars asked for the news
papers ; they were brought to him ; he laid aside three or four , and at
least ﬁxed on l I mp ar tia l it was the paper of which Beauchamp was the
chief editor He hastily tore off the cover, opened the jour nal with
nervous precipitation , passed contemptuously over the city column and
arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence , stopped , with a malicious

Very good ! observed Danglars afte r having r ead the paragraph ,

At the same moment , that is, at nine o clock in the morning Al be r t

He is really out, sir replied Baptistin
Out , even to me ?
I know how happy my master always is to receive M l e Co mte
said Baptistin ; and I shoul d therefore never include him in any
”
general order
You are right ; and now I wish to see him on an a ff air of g r eat
”
importance ; do you think it will be long before he comes in ?
’
”
N o , I think not ; for he ordered his breakfast at ten o clock
Well I will go and take a turn in the Champs Elys e es , and at ten
’
o clock I will return here ; meanwhile , if M l e Comte shoul d come in ,
will you beg hi m not to go out again without seeing me
”
You may depend on my doing so , sir, said Baptistin
Al bert left the ﬁa cre in which he had come standing at the door of
the count , intendi ng to take a turn on foot As he was passing the Al lée
’
des Veuves he thought he saw the count s horses standing at G osse t s
shooting -gallery ; he approached , and soon recognized the coachman
”
I s M le Comte shooting in the gallery ? said M orc e rf
”
Whil st he wa s speaking, Al bert
Y e s, sir , replied the coachman
had heard the report of two or thr ee pistol -shots He entered , and on
hi s way met the waiter
”
Excuse me , M l e Vicomte , s aid the lad ; but wil l you have the
”
kindness to wait a moment ?
”
What for, Philip ? asked Albert, who being a constant visitor
there did not understand this opposition to his entrance
Because the person wh o is now in the gallery prefers being al one
”
and never practices in the presence of any one
N ot even before you , Phili p ? Then who loads his pistol ?
His servant

A N ubian ?

A N egro
”
It is he then ?
”
Do you know this gentleman ?
”
Yes and I am c ome to look for him ; he is a friend of mine
Oh ! that is quite another thing , then
I will go immediately and

inform him of yo ur arri v al
And Phil ip , urged by his o wn curiosity, entered the galle ry ; a
second afterward Monte -Cri sto appeared on the threshold
”
I ask your pardon my dear count , said Albert , fo r following you
here ; and I must ﬁrst tell you that it was not the faul t of your servants
that I did so ; I alone am to blame for this indiscretion I went to your
house , and they told me you were out , but that they expected you home
at te n o clock to breakfast I was walking about in order to pass away

Beauchamp uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his f r iend
leap over and trample under foot all the newspapers which were strewed
about the room
”
Here ! here ! my dear Albert ! said he holding out his hand to the
young man
Are you out of your senses , or do you come peaceably

Beauchamp took the pape r , and read the article to which Albert
pointed , in an under-tone

You se e it is a serious annoyance s a id M orc e rf, when Beauchamp
had ﬁnished the perusal of the paragraph
”
Is the o fficer alluded to a relation of yours , then ? demanded the
j ournalist
Yes said Albert , blushing
”
Well , what do you wish me to do for you ? said Beauchamp ,
m il dly
”
My dear Beauchamp , I wish you to contradict this statement
Beauchamp looked at Albe r t with a benevolent expression
”
Come , said he , this matter will want a good deal of talking over ;
a retraction is always a serious thing, you know S it down and I will
”
read it again
Albert resumed his seat , and Beauchamp read , with more attention
than at ﬁrst , the lines denounced by his friend
Well said Albert , in a determined tone , you see that your paper
”
has insulted a member of my famil y and I insist 0 11 a retractation
You insist
Yes , I insist
Permit me to remind you that you are not very diplomatic , my dear

Viscount
”
N or do I wish to be , replied the young man ri sing
I repeat that
I am determined to have the announcement of yesterday contradicted

You have known me long enough , continued Albert , biting his lips
convulsively, for he saw that Beauchamp s anger was be gi nn ing to
rise
you have been my friend , and therefore suﬂi c ie ntly int imate
with me to be aware that I am likely to maintain my resolution on this

point
If I have been your friend , M orc e rf , your present manner of speak

M Fernand Mondego ,

whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace

Is it your father ? said Beauchamp ; that is quite another thing

At the words I will, Beauchamp steadily raised his eyes to A l bert s
countenance , and then as g radually lowering them , he remained
thoughtful for a few moments
You will retract this assertio n, will you not , Beauchamp ? ” said
Albert , with increased though stiﬂed anger

If you do not believe that it is
my father, say so immediately ; and if, on the contrary, you believe it

to be him , state your reasons for doi ng so
Beauchamp looked at Albert with the smile which was so peculiar
to him , and which , in it s numerous modiﬁcations , served to express
every varied feeling of his mind

satisfaction , you should have gone at once to t he point , and not have

Morre l now emerged from his hiding -place , whe r e he had remained

Morrel looked toward N o irt ie r for perm ission to retire The old

do so T he young man pressed Valentine s hand to his lips and then
left the house by a back staircase
At the same moment that he quitted the room Villefort and the

Barrois wa s now showi ng
signs of retur ning consciousness ; the crisis seemed p a st ; a low moan

Yes , mademoiselle , you especially, replied the doctor , abruptly

And Barrois turned toward Noirtie r, who, immovably
ﬁxed in his arm -chair, was contemplating this terrible scene without
all owing a word or movement to escape him

Where is this lemonade ? asked the doctor , eagerly
Downstairs , in the decanter

D A vri g ny bounded toward the door, ﬂew down the back staircase ,
and almost knocked d own Madame de Villefort in his haste , who was
herself going do wn to the kitchen D A vrig ny paid no attention to her ;
possessed with but one idea , he cleared the last four steps with a bound,
and rushed into the kitchen , where he saw the decanter about three
parts empty still standing on the waiter , W here it had been I W
darted upon it as an eagle on its prey Panting with loss of breath he
returned to the room he had just left Madame de Villefort slowly
ascended the steps which led to her room

asked d A vr ig ny
”
Yes , doctor
“
Is this the same lemonade of which you partook i?
”
I believe so
What did it taste like

It had a bitter taste
The doctorpoured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his
hand , put his lips to it , and after having rinsed his mouth as a man
does when he is tasting wine , he spat the liquor into the ﬁre -place

The magistrate trembled convulsively
There is a poison which destroys life almost wi thout l eaving any

The doctor was right ; steps were heard in the passage
M
d A vrig ny opened the door and took from the hands of the femme
de -chambre a cup which contained two or three spoonful s of the syrup ;
he then carefully closed the door
”
Look ! said he to the p rocureur da mi, whose heart beat so loudly
that it might almost b e heard ;
here is in this cup some syrup of vio
lets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which
M Noirt ier and Barrois partook If the lemonade be pure and inoff e n
sive , the syr up will keep its color ; if, on the contrary , the lemonade be
”
poisonous the syr up will become green Look well at it !
The doctor then slowly poured some dr ops of the lemonade from the
decanter into the cup , and in an instant , a kind of light cloudy sedi
ment began to form at the bottom of the cup ; this sedi ment ﬁ r st took
a blue shade , then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of Opal
and fro m opal to emerald
Arri ved at this last hue , it changed no
more The result of the experiment left no doubt whatever on the
mind

The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned , said d A vrig ny and

hair , mustaches i n perfect order, and white gloves which
ﬁtted admirably, had entered the court -yard of the banker s house in La

Chaussée d A nt in He had not been more than ten minutes i n the draw
ing-room before he drew Danglars aside into the recess of a bow-win
dow ; and , after an ingenious preamble , related to him all his anxieties
since his noble father s departure He had found , he said , in the banker s
family in which he had been received as a son , all the guarantees of
happiness , which one ought to seek for in preference to the caprices of
passion , and as regards passion itself, he had the felicity of meeting it
in the lovely eyes of M ademoiselle D anglars
D anglars listened with the most profound attention ; he had expected
this declaration the last two or three days ; and when at last it came
his eyes glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to M orc e rf
’
He woul d not , however, yield immediately to the you ng man s request ,
but made a few conscientious scruples
”
Are you not rather young, M And r ea , to think of marrying ?
”
I think not , sir, replied Cavalcanti ; in Italy the nobility gen
e r all y marry young ; life is so uncerta in , we ought to secure happiness
”
while it is withi n our reach
”
Well , sir, said D anglars , in case your proposals which do me
honor , are accepted by my wife and daughter , by whom shall the p r e
liminary arrangements be settled ? S o important a negotiation shoul d

I think be conducted by the respective fathers of the young people

Well pursued Cade r ousse , can you , without expending one sou,
put me in the way of getting ﬁfteen thousand francs ? N o ﬁfteen
thousand are not enough I can not again become an honest man with
”
less than thirty thousand francs

for my old comrades ; not like you , heartless creature , who woul d be
glad never to see them again !

Don t alarm yourself, my little Benedetto , but j ust point out to

To leave behind you the diamond you have on your ﬁnger We

How so ? said Andrea

You do well to boast of it , said Andrea , who , wi thout becoming

It is a false diamond , said Caderousse

Do not be angry ; we can try it

The count s ﬁ r st idea was that this wa s a n a rtiﬁce of a robber
a stupid trap to dr aw his attention from a minor danger in order to
expose him to a greater He wa s on the point of sending the letter to the
commissaire de police notwi thstanding the advice of his anonymous
friend , or, perhaps , bec a use of that advice when suddenly the idea
occu rred to him that it might be some personal enemy , whom he alone
should recogniz e , and over whom , if such were the case , he alone co uld
gain any advantage , as Fiesco had done over the Moor who would have
killed him We know the count s vigorous and daring mind , facing
impossibilities with that energy which makes the great man
From his past life from his resolution to shrink from nothing, the
count had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he
had engaged , sometimes against nature which is God sometimes against
the world, which may pass for the devil
”
They do not want my papers , said Monte -Cristo ; they want to
ki ll me : they are no robbers, but assassins I will not allow M le Préfet
de Police to interfere with my private a ff airs I am ri ch e nough for

The count recalled Baptistin , who had left the r oom after deli v e ring
the letter

I want all my household at Auteuil

But will no one remain in the house my lord ? asked Baptistin

The count signiﬁed his intention of dining alone , and that no one
b ut Ali s h o uld attend him Having dined with his usual tranqui ll ity
and mode r ation the count , making a signal to Ali to foll ow him , went
out b v the side -gate and , on reaching the Bois de Boul ogne turned ,
appa r ently with o ut design , toward Pa r is , and a t twilight found himself
All was da r k ; one solitary,
o pposite his house in the Champs Elys e es
fee ble light was b u r ning in the porter s lodge , about forty paces distant
f r om the house , a s Baptistin had said
M onte -Cr isto leaned against a tree , and , with that eye which was so
ra r ely d ecei v ed searched the double a v enue , examined the passers -b y
and carefully looked down the neighboring streets to see that no one was
concealed Ten minutes p a ssed thus , and he was convinced no one wa s
watching hi m He hastened to the side -door with Ali , entered pre c ipi
t a t e ly and by the s ervants staircase , of which he had the key , gained
his bedr oom without opening or disarranging a si ngle curtain , without
e v en the port er having the slightest suspicion that the house , which he
supposed empty contained its chief occupant
Arrived in his bedr oom , the count motioned to Ali to stop ; then he
pas s ed into the d ressing-room , which he examined : all wa s a s usual
the precious secrétaire in its place , and the key in the secrétaire He
doub ly locked it , took the key, retu rned to the bedr oo m door, removed
the dou ble staple of the bolt, and went in Meanwhile Ali had procured
the arms the count required ,— namely, a short carbine , and a pair of
dou ble -barreled pistols with which as sure an aim might be taken as
wi th a single -bar r eled one Thus armed , the count held the lives of
ﬁve men in his hands It was about half -past nine
The count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass
of S pan ish wine ; then Monte -Cristo slipped aside one of t he movable
panels , which enabled him to see into the adj oining room He had
within his reach his pistols and carbine , and Ali standing near him
held one of those small Arabian axes whose form has not varied since
the crusades Through one of the windows of the bedroom on a line
with that in the dr essing-room , th e count could se e into th e street
Two hour s passed thus It was intensely dark ; still Ali thanks t o
his wild natu r e and the count , thanks , doubtless , to his long c onﬁne
ment , could d istinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the
trees The little light in the lodge had been long extinct It might be
expected that the attack , if in deed an attack was proj ected , would be
made f r om the staircase of the ground-ﬂ oor and not from a window ; in
o
M nte Cristo s idea the villains sought h is life , not his money It woul d
b e his bedroom they would attack , and they must re ach it by the back
sta ircas e , or by the window in the dressing-room

At that moment Ali touched him slightly on th e shoulde r He turned ;
Ali pointed to the windo w of the room in which they we r e , facing the

He made a sign to A l i not to lose sight of the man in the
street and returned to the one in the dr essing-room
The glass -cutter had entered , and was feeling his way , his arms
st r etc hed out befo r e him He appeared to be familiar with everything
There we r e two doors ; he bolted them both
When he drew near to that of the bedroom , Monte -Cr isto expected
he was coming in , and raised one of his pistols ; but he simply heard
the sound of t he bolts sli di ng in their Copper rings It was only a pre

caution The nocturnal vi sito r , ignorant of the count s havi ng removed
the Staples , might no w think himself at home and pursue his purp ose
with ful l se c u ri ty
Alone and uncont r oll ed the man then che w from his pocket some
thing which the count could not discern placed it on a stand then went
st r aight to the secrétaire , felt the lock , and , contrary to his expectation
found that the key was missing But the glass -cutter was a p r udent
man who h ad p r ovided for all emergencies The count soon heard the
r attling of a bunch of shapeless keys , such as the locksmith brings when
call ed to fo r ce a lock , and which thieves call nightingales doubtless
from the music of their nightly song when they tu r n the precious lock
”
Ah ah ! whispered Monte -Cristo with a smile of di sappointment ,
he is only a thief !
But the man in the dark could not ﬁnd the right key He reached
the inst r ument he ha d placed on the stand , touched a spring and imme

attention was eng rossed with what was passi ng at the count s and his

Monte -C1i sto , I must beli eve on seeing you
Ca derousse raise d his clenched hands toward heaven
Listen , said the abbé , extending his hand over the wounded man ,
as if to command him to believe ; this is what the God in whom , on
your death -bed , you r efuse to believe has done for you ; he gave you
health st r ength , regul ar employment , even friends — a life in fact ,
which a man might enj oy with a calm conscience Instead Of improv

you have given yourself up to sloth and d r unkenness , and in a ﬁt of

you, you wo ul d now be dead Listen , the n

Listen continued the abbé
When you had betrayed your friend ,
God began not to strike , but to warn you ; poverty overtook you ; you
had already passed half your l ife in coveting that which you might have
hono r ably acquired , and already you contemplated crime under the
excuse of want , when God worked a miracle in your behalf , sending
you by my hands , a fortune — brilliant , indeed , for you , who had never
possessed any But this unexpected , unhoped -for, unheard -of fortune
su fﬁced you no longer when you once possessed it ; you wished to double
it ; and how -b y a murder ! You succeeded , and then God snatched it

Ah ! I understand said Beauchamp , on our friend Albert s
”
account
”
On my account ? said the young man ;
oh , no, indeed ! the count
will do me the j ustice to assert that I have , on the contrary, always
entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended
The count pretends I have not hi m to thank ; well , like the ancients , I
”
wil l raise an altar D6 0 ig noto
”
Listen , said Monte Cristo ; I have had little to do with it , for I
am at var iance both with the father -in-law and the young man ; there
is only Mademoiselle E ug e nie , wh o appears but little charmed with the
thoughts of matrimony, and who , seeing how little I wa s di sposed to
persuade her to renounce her dear liberty, retains any affection for me
Oh, ye s, in spite of all I could say
I do not know the young man ;
he is said to be of good family and rich , but in my eyes such stories are
mere gossip
I have repeated this to M Danglars till I am ti r ed , but
he is fascinated with his friend from Lucca
I have even informed
him of a circumstance I consider very serious ; the young man was
changed at nurse , either stolen by gypsies , or lost by his tutor , I
scar cely know which But I do know his father lost sight of him for
more than ten years ; what he did duri ng these ten years , God only
knows Well , all that wa s useless They have commissioned me to
wr ite to the maj or to demand his papers ; and here they are I send
”
them on , but will have nothing more to do with the matter
’
And what does Mademoiselle d A rmilly say to you for r o b bing he r
”
of her pupil ?
Forsooth ! I know not ; but I understand sh e i s going to Italy
Madame D anglars asked me for letters of recommendation for the
i mp rcsari ; I gave her a few lines for the director of the Del Valle
Theater , wh o is under some obligation to me But what is the matter,
Albert ? you look dull ; are you , after all unconsciously in love with
Mademoiselle Eug e nie ?
”
I am not aware of it said Albe r t , smiling so r r owfully Beauchamp
turned to look at some paintings
”
”
But , continued Monte -Cristo , you a r e not in your usual spi r its ?
”
I have a dreadful headache said Al b ert
Well ! my dear Viscount ,” said Monte -Cr isto , I have an infalli b le
”
r emedy to propose to you
”
What is that ? asked the young man
”
A change
Indeed ! said Albert

You annoyed coun t
said Beauchamp ; and by what ?
P a rdi e u’ you think very lightly of it ; I should like to se e you with
”
an indictment prepa ri ng in your house
”
What indictment ?
The one M de Villefort is preparing against my amiable assassin
”
some b r igand escaped from the galleys apparently
True ” said Beauchamp ; I saw it in the paper Who is this Cade
rousse
S ome p r ovincial , it appears M de Villefort heard of him at Mar
se illes and M Danglars recollects having seen him Consequently, NI lc
P roc ure m is very active in the aff air, and the prefect of police very much
inte r ested ; and , thanks to that interest , for whi ch I am very grateful ,
they send me all the robbers of Pa r is and the neighborhood , under pre
’
tense of their being Cade rousse s murderers ; so that in thre e months if
this continue , every robber and assassin in France will have the pl an of
’
my house at his ﬁngers ends Therefore , I am resolved to desert them
and to go to some remote corner of the earth , and shall be happy if you
”
will accompany me , Viscount
”
Will ingly
Then it is settled ?
”
Yes ; but where ?
I have told you , where the air is pure , where every sound soothes ,
where one is sure to be humbled , however proud may be his nature I
love that humi liation , I , who am master of the universe , as wa s Augustus
”
But where are you reall y going ?
To se a , Viscount ; to the se a — I am a sailor I was rocked when an
infant in the arms of old Ocean , and on the bosom of the beautiful Amphi
t ri te ; I have sported with the green mantle of the one a nd the azure
robe of the other ; I love the se a as a mistress , and pine if I do not often

”
Let us go , count
”
To the se a ?
”
Yes
You accept my proposal
I do
Well , V iscount , there will b e in my court -yard this evening a good
traveling britska with four post-horses , in which one may rest as in a

bed M Beauchamp , it holds four very well ; wil l you accompany us ?

Thank you , I have j ust returned from the sea

he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane

I never knew til now the delight of speed , said M orc e rf, and the
last cloud disappeared from his brow ; but where the devil do you get
such horses are they made to order ?
”
Precisely, said the count ; six years since I bought a ho r se in
Hungary remarkable for its swiftness I bought him for I know not
what sum ; it is B e rtuc c io who pays The thirty-two that we shall
use to -night are it s progeny they are all entirely black , with the e x c e p
”
tion of a star upon the forehead
That i s perfectly admirable ; but what do you do , count , with all
”
these horses ?
”
You se e , I travel with them
”
But you are not always traveling
When I no longer require them , B e rt uc c io will sell them ; and he
”
expects to realize thirty or forty thousand francs by the sale
But no monarch in Europe will be wealthy enough to purchase
”
them
Then he will sell them to some E astern vi zier, who will empty his
co ffers to purchase them , and r eﬁll them by applying the bastinado to
”
his subj ects
”
Count , may I suggest one ide a to you ?

Certainly
It is that , next to you , B e rt uc c io must be the richest gentleman in

E ur ope
You are mistaken , V iscount ; I am sure he has not a f r anc in his
pockets , if you turned them inside ou
Then he must be a wonder My dear count , if you tell me many
”
more marvelous things , I warn you I shall not beli eve them
There is nothing marvelous in my case M Albert ﬁgures out
common sense ; that is all N ow listen to this dilemma Why does a
”
steward rob his master ?
Because , I suppose , it is his nature to do so ; he robs for the love of
”
robbing
You are mistaken ; it is because he has a wif e and famil y, and
ambitious desires for himself and them Also because he is not sure of
always retaining his situation , and wishes to provide for the f uture
Now, M B e rtuc c io is alone in the world ; he uses my property without
accounting for the use he makes of it ; he is sure never to leave my

that it demanded t he undivi ded attention of the House ; but , at the
wo r ds Jan ina and Colonel Fernand he tur ned so a wfull y pale that
e v ery member shuddered and ﬁxed his eyes upon him Moral wounds
h ave this pec uliarity, they conceal themselves but never close ; always
p a inful , always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and
open in the heart
The article having been read d uring this painful silence , it was only
then disturbed by a unive rsal shudder , and immediately resto red when
the orator resumed He stated his scruples and the difﬁc ul ties of the
case it was the honor of M de M orc e rf, and that of the whole House ,
he p r oposed to defend by pro voking a debate on those personal ques
tions always so warmly agitated He concluded by calling for an exam
inat ion, speedy enough to confound t h e calumnious report before it had
time to spread , and to restore M de M orc e rf to the position he had long
held in public opinion
M o rc e rf was so completely overwhelmed by this enormous and une x
u

calamity
that

scarcely

a

words
as

looked

p
r ound on the assembly This timidity, which might proceed from the
astonishment of innocence as well as the shame of gui lt , conciliated some
in his favor ; for men who are truly generous are always ready to com
passionate when the misfort une of their enemy surpasses the limits of
their hatred The president put the question to the vote , and it wa s
decided that the examination sho ul d take place The count was asked
what t ime he requi red to p r epare his defense M o rc e rf s courage had
re vived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow
”
My lords answered he it is not by time that one repels attacks
like that made on me b y enemies unknown to me , and do ubtless , hidden
in obscu r ity ; it is immediately , and by a thunderbolt , I must repel the
ﬂash of lightning which , for a moment , sta r tled me Oh ! that I could
instead of taking up this defense , shed my las t drop of blood to p r ove
”
to my noble colleagues that I am their equal in wo rth
These wo r ds made a favo r able imp r ession on behalf of the accused
I demand then , that the examination shall take place as soon as
”
possi ble and I will fu r nish the house with all necessary information
What day do you ﬁx
asked the p r esident
”
To day I am at your se r v ice , replied the count
The president rang the bell

A committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the proofs
brought forward by M orc e rf
The examination woul d commence at

eight o clock that evening in the committee -room , and , if it were ne c e s

M orc e rf asked leave to retire ; he had to coll ect the documents he had

mingled wi th his sorrow , he would gladly have embraced those who
had given his fa t her th is proof of esteem at a moment when his honor
was so po we 1f ul ly attacked
At this moment one of the door-keepers brought in a letter for the

him wi t h a negotiation of life and death with the sultan He produced
the ring his mark of authority , with which Ali Pacha generally sealed
his lette r s and whi c h the latter had given to him that he might , on his
return at any hour of the day or night , were h e even in his harem , gain

a slave

And what e ﬁe c t did this discourse produce ? anxiously inquired
Albert
I acknowledge it affected me , and , i ndeed , all the commi ttee also ,
said Bea uchamp
Meanwhile , the president carelessly opened the letter which had been

M de M orc e rf, continued Beauchamp , looked at this woman with
surprise and te rror Her lips were about to pass his sentence of l ife o r
death To all the committee the a dventure was so extraordinary and
curious , that the interest they had felt for the count s safety became
no w quite a secondary matter The president himself advanced to place
a seat fo r the young lady ; but she indicated that she would remai n
standing As for the count he had fallen on his chai r ; it was evident
his legs refused to support him

They sent for a cab On entering the banke r s mansion , they per

Ah ! p ar bleu that s good , said Albert , with a gloomy tone
If

The servant announced the young man ; but the banker , recollect
ing what had transpired the day before , did not wish him admitted It
was , however , too late ; Albert had followed the footman , and , hearing
the order given , forced the door open , and , foll owed by Beauchamp
’
found himself in the banker s cabinet
S ir ,” cried the latter , am I no longer at liberty to receive whom I

Albe rt s attack on And r ea had placed him on a di ff erent footing , and he
hoped thi s visit had another cause tha n t hat he had at ﬁrst supposed
Indeed , sir said he to Al b ert , if you are come to quarrel wi th this

Yes ; miserable wretch cried M orc e rf, it is your fa ul t

Danglars retreated a few steps

S ir , said Beauchamp , who had not yet spoken , yo u appear to
accuse the count , who is absent from Paris at this moment , and cannot

j ustify himself
”
I accuse no one , sir, said D anglars ; I relate and I will repeat
”
before the count what I have said to you
Does the count know what answer you received ?
”
Yes ; I showed it to him
’
Did he know my father s Christian name was Fernand , and his family
name Mondego
Y e s ; I had told him that long since ; and I did nothing more than
any other would have done in my circumstances , and perhaps less
When , the day after the arrival of this answer , your father came , by
the advi ce of Monte -Cristo , to ask my daughter s hand for you , I decid
e dly refused him , but without any explanation or exposure
In sho r t ,
why should I have any more to do with the aff air ? How did the honor
or disgrace of M de M orc e rf aﬁe c t me ? It neither bulled nor bea r ed the
”
market
Albert felt the color mounting to his brow ; the r e was no d oubt

the same time with the assur ance of a man wh o speaks the truth , at
’
least in part , if not wholly
not for conscience sake , b ut th r ough fear
Besides what was M orc e rf seeking ? It was not whether Danglars o r
Monte -Cristo wa s more or less guil ty ; it was a man who would answer
for the o ff ense , whether triﬂing or serious ; it wa s a man who woul d
ﬁght and it was evident Danglars would not ﬁght

kindness M de Monte -Cristo saved your life you , yourself, presented
him to us Oh ! I entreat you , my son, if you had entertained such an
idea dispel it and my counsel to you — even more , my prayer is ,
retain his friendship
”
M y mother repl ied the you ng man , you have special reasons for
telling me to concil iate that man
”
I ! said Me r c e d e s blushing as rapidly as sh e had turned pale , and
again becoming paler than ever
Yes doubtless ; and it is not because he can never do us any harm ?
Me r c e d e s shuddered , and , ﬁxing on her son a scr utinizing gaze ,
”
You speak strangely, said she to Albert , and you appear to have
some singular prej u di ces Wh at has the count done ? Three days
since you were with him in N ormandy ; only three days since we looked

Merc e d e s saw it , and ,
A 1 1 ironical smile passed over Albert s lips
with her d ouble instinct of a woman and a mother , she g uessed all , but ,
prudent and strong-minded she concealed both her sorrows and her
fears Albert was silent ; an instant after , the countess resumed :
You came to inquire after my health ; I will can di dly acknowledge
I am not well You sho ul d install yourself h ere and cheer my soli tude
I do not wish to be left alone

My mother , said the young man , you know how gladly I wo ul d

Well ! replied Merc e d e s , sighing ; go , Albert, I will not make you
a slave to your ﬁlial piety

Albert pretended he did not hear, bowed to his mother, and quitted
her S carcely had he shut her door , than M erc e d e s called a conﬁdential
servant , and ordered him to follow Albert wherever he sho ul d go that
evening , and to come and tell her immediately what he observed Then

she rang for her lady s maid , and , weak as sh e w a s, sh e dressed , in order

over the front of the box looked round t he pit M orrel followed him ,
.
and looked also for his sister and brother-in-law ; he soon discovered
them in another box and kissed his han d to them
The count in his sur v ey of the pit , encountered a pale face and
threatening eyes which evidently sought to gain hi s attention He
recognized Al ber t , but thought it better not to notice him , as he looked
so an g ry and d iscomposed
Without communicating h is thoughts to
his companion he s a t down , d rew out his opera-glass , and looked
another way Although apparently not noticing Albert he did not ,
however, lose sight of him ; and when the curtain fell at the end of
the second act , he sa w him leave the orchestra with his two friends
Then his head was seen passing at th e back of the boxes , and the count
kne w the approaching storm was intended to fall on him He wa s at
the moment conversing cheerfully with Morrel but he was well p r epared
for what might happen
The door opened , and Monte -Cristo , turning round , saw Albert , pale
and trembling, followed by Beauchamp and Ch ateau -R enaud
”
Well , cried he , with tha t benevolent politeness which distingu
ished
his salutation fro m the common civilities of the world , my cavali er has
”
attained his obj ect Good evening M de M orc e rf
The countenance of this man who possessed such extraordinary
control over his feelings , expressed the most perfect c ordi alitMorrel
y
only then recollected the letter he had received from the Viscount in
which without assigning any reason , he begged him to go to the Opera
but he understood that something terrible was brooding
We are not come here , s ir, to exchange hypocritical expressions of
politeness , or false profe ssions of friendship said Albert
but to
”
demand an explanation , count
The trembling voice of the young man was scarcely audible
”
An explanation at the Opera ? said the count , with that calm tone
and penetrating eye which characterizes the man who knows his cause
is good
Little acquainted as I am with the habits of Parisians , I
”
should not have thought this the place for such a demand

said Albert , and cannot
, if people will shut themselves up

In pronouncing these wor d s Albert had raised his voice so as to be
heard by those in the adj oining boxes and in the lobby Thus the
attention of many was attracted by this altercation
”
Where are you come from , sir ? said Monte -Cristo
You do not
appear to be in the possession of your senses ”
Provided I understand your pe rﬁd y, sir, and succeed in making
you understand that I wi ll be revenged , I shall be reasonable enough ,”
said Albert , furiously
”
I do not understand you , sir replied Monte -Cristo ; and , if I di d,
your tone is too high I am at home here , and I alone have a right to
’
raise my voice above another s Leave the box , sir ! ”
Monte -Cristo pointed toward the door with the most commanding
dignity
Ah I shall know how to make you leave your home replied Albert,
clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which Monte-Cristo did not
lose sight of
”
!
Well , well
said M onte Cristo , quietly , I se e you wish to quarrel
with me : but I would give you one counsel , and do not forget it : it i s a
bad habit to make a display of a challenge Display is not becoming to
”
every one , M de M orc e rf
At this name a murmur of astonishment passed round the group of
spectators of this scene They had talked of no one but M orc e rf the
whole day Albert understood the allusion in a moment , and was about
to thr ow his glove at the count , when Morrel seized his hand , whil e
Beauchamp and Ch a teau -R enaud , fearing the scene would surpass the
limits of a challenge , held him back , but Monte -Cristo , without rising,
and leaning forward in hi s chair , merely extended his hand , and taking
the damp , crushed glove from the hand of the young man
”
S ir said he , in a solemn tone , I consider your glove thrown , and
wi ll ret urn it to you round a b ul let N ow, lea v e me or I will summon
”
my servants to throw you out at the door
Wild , almost unconscious , and with eyes inﬂamed , Albert stepped
back , and Morrel closed the door
Monte -Cristo took up his glass again a s if nothing had happened ;
he certainly must have had a heart of brass and face of marble Morrel
”
whispered , What have you done to him ?
”
I ? N othing
at leas t personally, said Monte Cristo
”
But there must be some cause for this strange scene
The Count de M orc e rf’ s adventure exasperates the young man

Have you anyt hing to do with it ?

Well !
Edmond I swear to you , by the he ad of that son for whom I entreat

balancing something shapeless and unknown at the top of a rock ;
d mi ng ten years I have heard each night a terrible cry which has
awoke me shuddering and col d And I , too , Edmond — oh ! believe

N o , interrupted Merc e d e s , but I have seen him whom I loved on

Merc e d e s pronounced these words with such deep anguish , with an
accent of such intense despair , that M onte -Cristo could not restrain a
sob The lion was daunted ; the avenger was conquered

”
What do you ask of me ? said h e ,

Merc e d e s uttered a cry which made the tears start from Monte

not suppose I can for one moment wish to live What I most loved
after you, Merc e d e s , was myself, my dignity, and that strength which

one word you have crushed it , and I die ”
But the duel will not take place , Edmond since you fo r give

Merc e d e s shrieked , and sprang toward Monte -Cr isto , but suddenly

st e pping :
E dmond , said she , there is a God above us , since you live
and since I have seen you again ; I trust to him from my heart While
waiting his assistance I trust to your word ; you have said my son should

?
live , have you not
”
Yes , madame he shall live , said Monte -Cr isto surprised that , with
out more emotion , Merc e d e s had accepted the heroic sacriﬁce he made
for her Merc e d e s extended her hand to the count
”
Edmond said she , and her eyes were wet with tears while looking
at him to whom sh e spoke , how noble it is of you , how g r eat the action
you have j ust performed ; how sublime to have taken pity on a poor
woman who oﬂ ere d herself to you with every chance against her ! Alas !
I am grown old wi th grief more than with years , and cannot now remind
my Edmond by a smile , or by a look , of that Merc e d e s whom he once
spent so many hours in contemplating Ah ! believe me , Edmond I told
you, I too had suff e r ed much ; I repeat it it is melancholy to pass one s
life without having one j oy to recall , without preserving a single hope ;
but that proves that all i s not yet over N o ; it is not ﬁnished , I feel it by
what remains in my heart Oh ! I repeat it , Edmond ; what you have
”
—
j ust done is beautiful it is grand , it is sublime
D o you say so, now Merc e d e s , and what wo ul d you say if you knew
the extent of the sacriﬁce I make to you ? S uppose the Creator, after
having made the world and vi viﬁe d chaos , had st e ppe d at the end of
one -third of his work , in order to spare an angel the tears which the
crimes of man would one day evoke from heavenly eyes ; suppose that
when all was prepared , ready , quickened , God at the time when he saw
his work was good had extinguis hed the sun and ki cked aside the earth
into endl ess night , then you might have some idea of my sacriﬁce But
no , no you cannot imagine what I lose in sacriﬁcing my life at th i s

The count smiled bitterly

yielded to the pain of the emotion excited in my breast by a woman s

voice
Yet , continued the count, becoming each moment more absorbed
in the anticipation of the d readful sacriﬁce for the morrow, which
Merc e d e s had accepte d , yet , it is impossible that so noble -minded a
woman should thus , through selﬁshness , consent to my death when in
the p ri me of life and strength ; it is impossi ble she can carry to such a
point maternal love , or rather delirium
There are vi r tues whi ch
become c ri me s by exaggeration N o , she must have conceived some
pathetic scene ; she will come and throw herself between us , and what
”
would be sublime here will appear there ridiculous
The blush of p ri de mounted to the count s forehead a s this thought
passed th r ough his mind
”
R idiculous ? repeated he ;

I
”
ridiculous ! no , I would rather die
Thus exaggerating to his own mind the anticipated ill -fortune of the
next day, to which he had condemned himself by promising Merc e d e s
to spare her son, the count at last exclaimed
Folly ! folly ! foll y ! to carry generosity so far as to place myself as
a mark for that young man to aim at He will never believe my death
was a suicide ; and yet it is important for the honor of my memory,
and this , surely is not vanity, but a j ustiﬁable pride , — it is important
the world should know that I have consented , by my free wi ll , to stop
my a r m , ah e a d y raised to strike , and that with that arm , so powerful

S eizing a pen he dr ew a paper from a se c ret drawer in his bureau ,

will made since his ar rival in Pa r is , a so r t of codicil , clearly explaining
the natu r e of his death
”
I do this , 0 my God ! said he , with his eyes raised to heaven , as

himself , shall imagine that chance has freed them from their enemy
Let them know on the contrary, that their punishment , which had been
dec r eed by Provi dence , is only delayed by my present determination ;
and although they escape it in this worl d , it awaits them in another and

that they are only exchanging time for eternity

It wa s j ust ﬁve o clock in the morning, when a slight noise reached
his ear , which appeared like a stiﬂed s igh ; he tur ned his head , looked
around him , an d saw no one ; but the sound was repeated distinctly
enough to convince him of its reality He arose , and quietly opening
the door of the drawing-room , saw Hayd e e , who had fallen on a chair

had bee n standi ng at the door to prevent his going out without seeing

her head

Do you thi nk of dying , my lord ? said she
”
The wise man has said it is good to th ink of death , my child

Well , if you die , said she , bequeath your fortune to others ; fo r

four pieces and threw it into the middle of the room Then , the e ffort

The count leaned over her and raised her in his arms ; and seeing
that sweet pale face , those lovely eyes closed , that beautiful form
motionless , and to all appearance lifeless , the idea occurred to him for
the ﬁ rst time that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a daughte r
lo v es a father
Alas ! ” murmu r ed he with intense suff ering , I might then ha v e

You are doubtless provided with pistols , gentlemen ? said Morrel
”
M de Monte Cristo yi elds his right of using his,
We had anticipated thi s kindness on the part of the count , said
Beauchamp and I have brought some arms which I bought eight or
ten days since thinking to want them on a similar occasion They are
”
quite new and have not yet been used Will you examine them ?
”
Oh M Beauchamp , replied Mo rrel with a bow, if you assure me
M de M orc e rf does not know these a r ms you may readily believe your
”
word will be quite su fficient
”
Gentlemen , said Ch a teau-R enaud it is not M orc e rf coming in that
carriage ; — faith , it is F r anz and Debray
The t wo young men he announced were indeed approaching
What
”
chance b ri ngs you here gentlemen ? said Ch a teau-R enaud , shaking
hands with each of them
”
Because , said Debray Albert sent this morning to request us to
”
come
Beauchamp and Ch ateau-R enaud exchanged looks of astonish
ment
”
I think I understand his reason , said Morrel
”
What is it ?
Yesterday afternoon I received a letter from M de M orc e rf, begging
me to attend the Opera
”
And I , said Debray
”
And I also , said Fra nz
”
And we , too , added Beauchamp and Ch ateau-R enaud
Havi ng
wished you all to witness the challenge , he now wishes you to be present
at the combat
Exactly so said th e young men ; you have prob ab lv guessed
”
right
”
But , after all t hese arrangements , he does not come himself , said
”
Ch a teau R enaud ;
Albert is ten minutes after time
”
There he comes ! said Beauchamp ; on horseback , at f ull gallop ,
”
followed by a servant
”
How imprudent ! said Ch a teau -R enaud to come on horseback to
”
i
ﬁght w th the pistol , after all the instruc tions I had given him
”
And besides , said Beauchamp , with a collar above his cravat an
open coat and wh ite waistcoat ? Why has he not painted a spot upon
”
his heart
it would ha v e been more simple
Meanwhile Albert had a r rived within ten paces of the group formed
by the ﬁve young men He jumped from his horse , threw the b ri dl e on
his servant s arms , and j oined them He was pale , and his eyes we r e
red and swollen ; it was evident that he had not slept A shade of
melancholy gravity overspread his countenance , wh i ch was not natur al
to him

”

”
In private ? asked Morrel
”
N o sir ; before all who are here
Albe r t s seconds looked at each other ; Franz and De b ra v exchanged
some words in a whisper ; and Morrel , rej oiced at this unexpected inci

Emmanuel
”
Wh at does he want with me ? said Monte -Cristo
”
I do not know , but he wi shes to speak to you
”
Ah ? said Monte -Cristo , I trust he is not going to tempt me by
”
some fresh insult !
”
I do not think such is hi s intention , said Morrel
The count advanced , a c c omp a nie d b y Maximilian and Emmanuel ;
his calm and serene look formed a singul ar contrast to Albert s grief

When at three paces distant , Albert and the count stopped
”
Approach , gentlemen , said Albert ; I wish you not to lose one

Monte -Cristo ; for it must be repeat e d by you to all wh o will listen to

it strange as it may appear to you
”
Proceed , sir , said the count
”
S ir , said Albert , at ﬁr st with a tremulous voice , but which gradu

de M orc e rf in Epirus for , guilty as I knew he was , I thought you had
no right to punish him ; but I have since learned you have that right
It is not Fernand M ond e g o s treachery toward Ali Pacha which induces
me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the ﬁsherman Fernand

have become embarrassing for all if th e conversation h ad continued
”
Farewell , Albert , said Beauchamp suddenly, carelessly extending
his hand to the young man , without the latter appearing to rouse from
his lethargy ; in fact , he did not notice the o ff ered hand
”
Farewell , said Ch a teau-R en aud in his turn , keeping the l ittle cane
in his left ha nd , and bowing with his right
’
”
Albert s lips scarcely whispered Farewell , but his look was more
explicit : it embraced a whole poem of restrained anger, proud disdain
and generous in di gnation He preserved his melancholy and motionless
position for some time after his t wo frien ds had regained their carriage ;
then , suddenly loosing his horse from the little tree to which his servant
had fastened it , he sprang on it , a nd galloped o ﬂ in the direction of
Paris
In a quarter of an hour he was entering the hotel of the R ue d u
Helder As he a l ighted he th ought he saw behind the curtain of the
’
count s bedroom his father s pale face A l bert turned away his head
with a sigh , and went to his own apartments He cast one lingering
look on all the luxuries which had rendered life so easy and so happy
since his infancy ; he looked at the pictures , whose faces seemed to smile ,
and the landscapes , which appeared painted in brighter colors Then
’
he too k away his mother s portrait , with its oaken frame , leaving the
gilt frame , from which he took it , black and empty Then he arranged
all his beautiful T urkish arms , his ﬁne English guns , his Japanese china ,
his cups mounted in silver , his artistic bronzes , signed Feuch e res or
Barye ; examined the cupboards , and placed the key in each ; threw into
the d rawer of his secrétaire , which he left open , all the pocket-money he
had about him , and with it the thousand fancy j ewels from his vases
and his j ewel -boxes made an exact inventory of all , and pl aced it in
the most conspicuous part of the table , after putting aside the books
and papers which encumbered it
At the commencement of this work , his servant , not wi thstan di ng

Al bert ; break off their acquaintance But do not despair ; you have

years old ; and a s a pure heart like yours wants a spotless name , take
my father s — it was Herrera I am sure , Albe r t , whatever may be

It is miraculous ! continued Morrel ans werin ghis own thoughts
”
What ? said Monte -Cristo
”
What has j us t happened
”
Yes said the count , you are right — it is miraculous
”
For Albert is brave resumed Morrel
”
Very b r ave , said Monte -Cristo ; I have seen him sleep with a
”
swo r d suspended over his head
”
And I know he has fought two duels said Morrel ; how can you
reconcile that with his conduct this morning ?
”
A ll owi ng to your inﬂuence , replied Monte -Cristo , smiling
”
It is well for Albert he is not in th e army , said Morrel
Why
An a pology on the ground ! said the young cap t ain , shaking his
head
”
Come said the count , mildly, do not entertain the prej udi ces of
ordinary men , Morrel ! Acknowledge , if A l bert is brave , he cannot be
a coward ; he must then have had some reason for acting as he did this
”
morning and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise
”
Doubtless , doubtless , said M orrel ; but I shall say , l ike the S pan
’
i ard He has not been so brave to day as he was yesterday
You will b r eakfast with me , will you not , Morrel
said the count ,
to tu r n the con v ersatio n
”
N o I must leave you at ten o clock
”
Your engagement was for breakfast , then ? said the count
Morrel smiled and shook his head
”
S till you must breakfast somew here
”
But if I am not hungry ? said the young man
”
Oh ! said the c ount , I only know two things which destroy the
appetite ; g r ief, and as I am happy to se e you very cheerful it is not
that , and love N ow , after what you told me this morning of your
heart , I may believe
”
”
Well , count , replied Morrel , gayly, I will not dispute it
”
But you will not make me your conﬁdant , Maximilian ? said the
count i n a tone which showed how gladly he would have been admitted
to the secret
I showed you this morning I had a hear t ; di d I not , count ?
Monte -Cristo only answered by exten di ng his hand to the young man
”
Well ! continued the latt e r, since that heart is no longer with you
”
in the Bois de V incennes , it is elsewhere , and I must go and ﬁnd it
”
Go , said the count deliberately, go , dear friend , but promise me ,

They had arrived in the Champs Elys e es Mont

Morrel di sappeared through the avenue of Marigny ,

and M onte -Cr isto hastened to j oin B e rtuc c io
”
Well ? asked h e

And her son ?
”
Florentin , his valet , thinks he is going to do the same

Monte

wrote the letter we have seen , and gave it to the steward
Go , said
”
he qui ckly
Apropos , let Hayd e e be informed I am ret urned
”
Here I am , said the young girl , who, at the sound of the carriage ,
had run downstairs , and whose face was radiant with j oy at seeing the
count return safely Every transport of a d aughter ﬁndi ng a father ,
all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover , were felt by Hayd e e
during the ﬁrst moments of this meeting , which sh e had so eagerly
expected Doubtless , although less evident , Monte -Cristo s j oy was not
less intense ; j oy to heart s which have suffered long is like the dew on
the ground after a long dro ught ; both the heart and the g round absorb
that b e ne ﬁc e nt moisture falling on them , and nothing is outwardly
apparent
Monte -Cristo was beginning to think , what he had not for a long time
d ared to believe , that there were two Merc e d e s in the world and he
might yet be happy His eye , elate with happiness , wa s reading eagerly
the moistened gaze of Hayd e e , when suddenly the door opened The
count knit his brow

M de M orc e rf ! said Baptistin , as if that name sufﬁ ced for hi s
’
excuse In fact , the count s face brightened

”
Which , asked he , the Viscount or the count ?

The count

exclaimed Hayd e e , is it not yet over ?
Oh

I know not if it is ﬁnished , my beloved c hi ld , said Monte -Cristo ,
’
taki ng the young gir l s hands ; but I do know you have nothing more
”
to fear
But it is the wretched
”
That man can not inj ure me , Hayd e e , said Monte -Cristo ; it was
”
his son alone there was cause to fear
”
And what I have suff ered , said the young girl , you shall never
”
know my lord

”
Monte Cristo smiled
B y my father s tomb ! said he , extending
his hand over the head of the young girl , I swear to you , Hayd e e

that if any misfortune happens , it will not be to me

I believe you , my lord , as implicitly a s if God had spoken to me ”

said the young gi rl , presenting her forehead to him Monte -Cristo

into the drawing room , said he to Bap
tistin , while he led the beautiful Greek girl to a pr ivate stai r case
We must explain this visit , which although Monte -Cr isto expected
it is unexpected to our readers While Merc e d e s , as we have said , wa s
making a similar inventory of her property to Albert s while she wa s
arranging her j ewels shutting her d r awers , collecting her keys to leave
everythi ng in perfect order , s he did not percei v e a pale and sinister face
at a glass door which threw light into the passage , f rom which every
thing could be both seen and heard He who was thus looking, with
out being heard or seen , probably heard and saw all that passed in
’
Madame de M orc e rf s apartments From that glass door the pale -faced
’
man went to the count s bed r oom , and r aised with a contracted hand
the curtai n of a window o v e r looking the court-ya r d He r emained there
ten minutes motionless and dum b listening to the beating of his own
heart For him those ten minutes w ere very long It was then that
Albert , r etur ned from his r endezvous , perceived his father watching
for his ar r ival behind a curtain and turned aside The count s eye
expanded ; he kne w Albert had insulted the count d r eadfully, and that ,
in every country in the world , such an insult would lead to a deadly
duel Albert returned safely — the n the count wa s r evenged
An indescri b able ray of j oy illumined that w r etched countenance ,
li ke the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind t he mass of
clouds which appear more like its tomb than its couch But, as we have
said , he waited in vain for his son to come to hi s apartment with the
account of his triumph
He easily understood why his son did not
’
come to see him before he went to avenge his fathe r s honor ; but when
that was done , wh y did not his son come and th r ow himse lf into his
arms ?
It was then , when the count could not se e Albert he sent for h is
servant , whom he knew was authorized not to conceal anything from
him
T e n minutes afterward the General M orc e rf wa s seen on the
steps in a black coat with a military coll a r , black pantaloons and black
gloves He had apparently given p r evious orders ; fo r , as he reached
the bottom step his carriage came from the coach-house ready for him
The valet threw into the carriage his mil itary cloak in which t wo
swords were wrapped ; and , shutting the door, took his seat by the
side of the coachman The coachman stooped down for his o r ders

Q uickly !
The horses bounded beneath the whip , and , in ﬁve minutes , they
stopped before the count s door M orc e rf opened the door himself ; and
as the carriage rolled away , he passed up the walk , rang, and entered
the ope n door with his servant
A moment afte rward Baptistin announced the Count de M orc e rf to
Monte -Cristo ; and the latter , le adi ng Hayd e e aside , ordered the Count
de M orc e rf to be asked into the drawing-room The general was pacing
the room the thir d time , when , in turning, he perceived Monte -Cristo at
the door
”
Eh ! it is M de M orc e rf, said Monte -Cristo , quietly ; I thought I
”
had heard wrong
”
Y e s, it is I , said the count , whom a frightful contraction of the
lips prevented from articulating freely
May I know the cause which procures me the pleasure of seeing M
”
de M orc e rf so early ?
”
Had you not a meeting with my son this morn i ng ? asked the
general
”
I had , repli ed the count
And I know my son had good reason s to wish to ﬁght with you , and
”
to endeavor to kill you
Yes , sir , he had very good ones ; but you se e , in spite of them he has
”
not killed me and did not even ﬁght
Yet he considered you the cause of his father s dishonor , the cause
”
of the fearful rui n which has fallen on my house
”
Truly, sir, said M onte -Cristo , with his dreadf ul calmness , a se c
”
ondary cause , but not the principal
Doubtless you made , then , some apology or explanation ?
”
I explained nothing, and it is he who apologized to me
”
But to what do you att ri bute this conduct ?
To the conviction , probably , that there wa s one more guil ty than

You expected my son would be a coward ? cried the count
M Albert de M orc e rf is no coward

A man who holds a sword in his hand , and sees a mortal enemy
within reach of that sword , and does not ﬁght , is a coward ! Why is he

ear his bedroom , and , in less than a moment teari ng off his cravat his
coat and waistcoat , he put on a sailo r s j acket and hat from beneath
which r olled h is long black hair
He returned thus , fo r midable and implacable , advancing with his
arms crossed on his breast , toward the g eneral , who could not under
stand why he had disappeared ; but who on seeing him again , and feel
ing his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him , drew back , and only
stopped when he found a table to support his clinched hand
Fernand c ried he , of my hund r ed names I need only tell you one
to o v erwhelm you ! But you guess it now, d o you not ? — o r rather ,
you remember it ? For , not withstanding all my sorrows and my to r t
u r es , I show you to -day a face which th e happiness of revenge makes
—
young again a face you must often have seen in you r d r eams since
your ma r r iage with Merc e d e s , my betrothed
The general , with his head thrown back , hands extende d gaze
ﬁx ed looked silently at this dreadful apparition ; then , seeki ng the wall
to support him , he glided along close to it until he reached the door,
through which he went out back ward uttering this single mournful
lamentable , distressing cry :
Edmond D ant e s
Then , with sighs which were unlike any human sound , he dragged
hi mself to the door , reeled across the court -yard and falling into the
arms of his valet , he said in a voice scarcely intelligible ,— Home !

home !
The fresh air and the shame he felt at h a v ing exposed himself
before his servants partially recalled his senses ; but the ride was sho r t
and as he dre w near his house all his wretchedness re vived He stopped
at a sho r t distance from the house and alighted The door of the hote l
was wide open , a hackney-coach was stan ding in t he middle of the
yard — a strange sight before so noble a mansion ; the count looked at it
with terror ; but without daring to ask , he rushed towa r d his apartment
T wo pe r sons were coming down the stairs ; he had only time to

words

may easily conceive where Morrel s appointment was On
leaving M onte -Cristo he walked slowly toward V ill e fort s ;
we say slowly , for Mo r rel had more than h alf-a n-hour to
spare to go ﬁve hundr ed steps but he had hastened to take
eave
of
Monte
Cristo because he wished to be alone with his thoughts
l
He knew his time well — the hour when Valentine was giving Noirt ier
his breakfas t, and wa s sure not to be disturbed in the pe r formance of
this pious duty No irt ier and Valentine had gi ven him leave to go
twice a week , and he was now availing himself of that pe r mission
He arrived ; Valentine was expecting him
U neasy and almost
wande r ing, sh e seized his hand and led him to he r g r andfathe r This
uneas iness , amounting almost to wildness arose f r om the report Mor
cerf s adventu r e had made in the world ; the a ff ai r of the Ope r a was
generally known N o one at V i ll e fo rt s doubted that a duel would
ensue from i t Valentine , with her woman s instinct , guessed that Mor
rel would be Monte -Cristo s witness , and f r om the young man s well
known courage and his g r eat a ffection fo r t he count , sh e feared he
would not content himself with the passive part assigned to him We
may easil y understand how eage r ly the particulars we r e a sked for,
given and received ; and Mor r el could read a n indescribable j oy i n the
eyes of his beloved when she knew that the te r minatio n of t his a ﬂ air
was as happy as it was unexpected
”
N o w, said Valentine , motioni ng to Mo rr el to s it down near he r

An excellent one ! said Valentine
He pretends the air of the

Faubourg S aint Honor e is not good for me
”
Indeed ! said Morrel ;
in that M Noirt ie r may be right ; your
”
health has not appeared good the last fortnight
N ot ver y , said Valentine
And grandpapa is become my phy
s ic ia n ; and I have the greatest conﬁdence in him, because he knows
eve r ything
”
Do you then really su ffer ? asked M orrel , quickly
Oh, it must not be called su ff ering ; I feel a general uneasiness , th at
is all I have lost my appetite , and my stomach feels to be struggling
”
to become accustomed to something
N oirt ie r did not lose a word of
what Valentine said
And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint ?
”
A ve ry simple one , said Valentine
I swall ow every mo r ning a
spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandf ather When I say one
spoonful , I began by one — now I take four
Grandpapa says it is a

panacea
Valentine smiled , but it was evident sh e suﬂ e re d
Maximilian in his devotedness , gazed silently at her S he was very
beautiful , but her usual paleness had increased ; her eyes were mo r e
brilliant than ever , an d her hands , which were generally white like
mothe r -of-pearl , now more resembled wa x , to which time was adding a
yellowish hue
From Valentine the you ng man looked toward Noirt ie r The latter
watched with strange and deep interest the young girl , absorbed by her
a ff ection ; and h e also , like Morr el , followed those traces of inward s uf
f e ring , which were so little perceptible to a common observer that they
escaped the notice of every one but the grandfather and the lover
”
But , said Morrel I thought this mixture of which you now take
four spoonful s , was prepared for M N oirt ie r

I know it is very bitter said Valentine ; so bitter , that all I dr ink

N oirtie r looked inquiringly

N oirtie r turned pale , and made
a sign that he wished to speak
Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary N oirtie r watched her with
evident anguish In fact , the blood was rushing to the young g irl s head
already her cheeks were becomi ng red

Mo rrel watched her as sh e left the r oom ; he heard h e r ascend the
little staircase which led both to Madame de V ille fo rt s apartments and
to hers As soon as she was gone N ortier made a sign to Morrel to take
the dictiona r y Morrel obeyed ; guided by Valentine , he had learned
Accustomed , however , as he
h o w to unde r stand the old man quickly
wa s, and havi ng to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet , and to
ﬁnd every word in the dictionary, it was ten m inutes before the thought
of the old man was translated by these words
Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentine s room
’
Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois
situation , and in N o irt ie r s name gave that order The servant soon

The decanter and the glass were completely empty Noirt ie r
made a sign that he wished to speak
”
Why are the glass and the decanter empty ? asked he ; Valentine

said sh e only dr ank half the glassful
The t r an slation of this ne w question occupied anothe r ﬁve minutes
”
I do not know said the servant but the housemaid is in Made

”
moiselle Valentine s room ; perhaps she has emptied them
Ask her said Morrel , translating Noirt ie r s thought this time by
his look The servant went out but returned almost imme diately
Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go to Madame

de V ill e fort s, said he ; and in passing, as she wa s thirsty, she dr ank
what remained in the glass ; as for the decante r , M Edward had emptied
that to make a pond for his ducks
N o irt ie r raised hi s eyes to heaven , as a gambler does who stakes his
all on one stroke From that moment the old man s eyes were ﬁxed on
the door , and did not quit it
It was indeed M adame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine

had seen ; they had been ushered into M adame de V ille fort s room , who
had said she would receive them there That is why Valentine passed
th r ough her room which wa s on a level with Valentine s and o nly sep a

with that sort of ofﬁcial stiffness which announced a communication

And , sa id Madame de Villefort , I need not ask you if you share

free in heart , in person , and in thought
Eug e nie pronounced these words with so ﬁrm a tone that the color
mounted to Valentine s cheeks The timid girl co uld not understan d
that vigorous nature which appeared to have none of the timi di ties of
woman
”
At any rate , said she , since I am to be mar ri ed whether I wil l or
not , I ought to be thankf ul to Providence for having released me from
my engagement with M Albert de M orc e rf, or I should this day have

The general depended much on it ; he even came to fo r ce M Danglars

Valentine kissed Eug e nie , bowed to Madame Danglars , wh o had
al r eady risen to take her leave and went out
”
That poor c hi l d, said Madame de Vill efort , when Valentine was
gone , she makes me very uneasy , and I shoul d not be astonished if

she had some serious illness
Meanwhile Valentine , in a sort of excitement which she co uld not
quite understand had crossed E dward s room without paying any atten

little staircase
S he was at the bottom excepting three steps ; she already heard
’
Morrel s voice , when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes , her sti ff ened
foot missed the step , her hands had no power to hold the baluster , a nd
falling against the wall , she rolled down these three steps rather than
walked Morrel bounded to the door , Opened it , and found Valentine
extended on the ﬂoor R apid as lightning, he raised her in his arms
and placed her in a chair Valentine opened her eyes

Oh , what a clumsy thing I am ! said she , wi th feverish volubility ;
I no longer know my way I forgot there were three more steps before

You have hurt yom se l f, perhaps , said Morrel

Valentine looked around her ; she saw the deepest terror depicted in

Comfort yourself, dear grandpapa , said she , endeavoring to smile ;

But no , said Valentine ,

Morrel consulted N oirt ie r s look , wh o had recove r ed his

The same cab which h a d brought Villefort took them back at f ull
speed , at the very moment when Morrel rapped at Monte -Cristo s door
The count wa s in his cabinet , and was reading, with an angry look ,
something which B e rtuc c io had brought in haste
Hearing Morrel
a nnounced , wh o had left him only two hours before , the count raised
his head He , as well as the count , had evidently been much tried during
those two hours , for the young man had left him smiling and returned
with a disturbed air The count rose , and sprang to meet him
”
What is the matter, Maximili an ? asked he ; you are pale , and

the perspiration roll s from your forehead
M orrel fell , rather than sat

Is all your family well ? asked the count with an affectionate
benevolence , whose since ri ty no one coul d for a moment doubt

Thank you , count
thank you , said the young man , evidently
embarr assed how to begin the conversation ; yes , every one in my

S o much the better ; yet you have something to tell me ? replied
the count , with increased anxiety

Yes , said Morrel it is true ; I have j ust left a house where death

The general has j ust blown his brains out , replied Monte -Cristo ,
with great coolness
Oh ! what a dreadful event ! cried Maximilian

N ot for the countess , nor for A l bert said Monte -Cristo ; a dead
father or husband is better than a di shonored one : blood washes out
shame

Yes , my dear count I heard it ; and the doctor added , that if
another death occur r ed in a simila r way he must appeal to justice

Monte risto listened or appeared to d o so with the g r eatest calm

Well
said Maximil ian death came a thi r d time , and neither the
master of the house nor the d octor said a wo r d Death is now perhaps

Count , what am I bound to do , being in posses

”
My dear friend , said Monte Cristo , you appea r to be relating an
adventure which we all know by heart I know the house where you
heard it or one very similar to it ; a house with a garden a master a
physician , and whe r e there have been three unexpected and sudden
deaths Well ! I h ave not intercepted your conﬁdence , and yet I know
all that as well as you , and I have no conscientious scruples
N o it
does not conce r n me You say an exterminating angel appears to have
devoted t hat house to God s anger — well ! wh o says your supposition
is not reality ? Do not notice things which those whose interest is to
se e them pass over
If it is God s j ustice , instead of his ange r , which
is walking through that house , Maximilian , turn away your face , and let
”
his j ustice accomplish its pu r pose
Mo r rel shuddered T here was something mournful solemn and
’
terrible in the count s m a nner

Besides , continued he , in so changed a tone that no one would have
supposed it was the same person speaking
besides who says that it

It has returned , count ! exclaimed Mo rr el ; that is why I hastened

to you
Well ! wh at do you wish me to do ? Do you wish me for instance
to give information to the p rocure ur da r oi
Monte -Cr isto uttered the
last words with so much meaning that Mor r el starting up , cried out :

have seen in a prece di ng chapter Madame D anglars coming
formally to announce to Madame de Vill efort the approach
ing marriage of Eug e nie Danglars and Andrea Cavalc anti
This formal announcement , which implied , or appeared to
imply, a resolution taken by all the parties concerned in this great affair,
had been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be a dmitted
We beg them to take one step backward , and to transport themselves,
the morning of that day of great catastrophes , into the beautifully
gilded salon we have before shown them , and which was the pride of
its owner, the Baron D anglars
’
I n this room , at about ten o clock in the morning , the banker himself
had been walking some minutes , thoughtful , and evidently uneasy,
watching each door , and listening to every sound When his patience
was exhausted he called his valet
”
S tephen , said he , se e why Mademoiselle Euge nie has asked me
”
to meet her in the drawing room , and why she makes me wait so long
Having given this vent to his ill -humor , the baron became more calm ;
Mademoiselle D anglars had that morning requested an interview with
her father and had ﬁx ed on that dr awing-room as the spot The singu
l arit y of this step , and , above all , it s formal character, had not a little
surprised the banker , who had immediately obeyed his daughter by
repairi ng ﬁrst to the drawing-room S tephen soon returned from his
errand
’
’
M ademoiselle s lady s maid says , sir, that mademoiselle is ﬁnishing
”
her toilet , and will be here shortly
D anglars nodded , to signif y he wa s satisﬁed To the world and to
his servants Danglars assumed the good-nat ured man and the weak
father This was one of his characters in the popular comedy he was

performing ; it was a physiognomy he had adopted , and which appeared
as suitable to him as it wa s to the right side of the proﬁle masks of the
fathers of the ancient theaters to have a turned-up and laughing li p,
while , on the left side it was drawn down and sul ky Let us hasten to
sa y that , in private , the turned -u

level of the drawn -down and ill -tempered one ; so that , generally , the
indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and
dominee r ing father
Why the devil does that foolish g irl who pretends to wish to speak
to me not come into my cabinet ? and wh y, above all , can she want to
speak to me at all ?
He was revolving this wo rr ying th ought in his brain for the twen
t ie t h time , when the door opened , and Eug e nie appeared attired in a
ﬁgured black satin dr ess , her hair arranged , and gloves on as if go ing
to the Italian Opera
Well Eug e nie what is it you want with me ? and why in this
”
solemn dr awing room when the cabinet is so comfortab le ?
”
You are right , sir , replied Eug e nie , making a sig n to her father
that he could sit down ;
and have proposed two questions which
include all the conversation we are going to have I will answer them
both , and , contrary to the usual meth od , the last ﬁrst , as being the
least complex I have chosen the d rawing-room sir, as our place of
rendezvous , in order to avoid the disa g reeable impressions and inﬂ u

inﬂuence on a fathe r s mind , and make him forget there is in the world
an interest greater an d more sacred than the good opinion of his corre
spond e nt s I have , therefore , chosen this dr awing -room , where you see ,
smiling and happy in their magniﬁcent frames , your po r trait , mine , my
’
mother s and all sorts of rural landscapes and touching pastorals I
rely much on external impressions ; perhaps , with regard to you , they
”
are immaterial ; but I should be no artist if I had not some fancies
”
Very well , replied D anglars , who had listened to all this preamble
with imperturbable coolness , but without understanding a word ,
engaged as he wa s, like every man burdened wit h hidden thoughts , in
seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speake r
”
There i s , then , the second point cleared up , or nearly so, said
Eug e nie , without the least confusion and with that masculine pointed
ness which distinguished her gesture and her language ;
and you
appear satisﬁed with the explanation N ow , let us return to the ﬁrst !

Well , sir, replied Eug e nie , I have tried to the very last ; and now

the moment ha s come , in spite of all my e ﬂ ort s, I feel it is impossible

But , said Danglars , whose weak mi nd was at ﬁrst quite over
whelmed with the weight of this pit iless lo gi c , marking evi dent pre
meditation and force of wil l , what is your reason for this refusal
”
Eug e nie ? what reason do you assign ?
”
My reason ? replied the young girl
Well ! it is not that the
man is more ugly , more foolish , or more disagreeable than any other ;

no , M An drea Cav al canti may appear to those who look at men s faces
and ﬁgures a very good model I t is not , either , that my heart is less

particular person
Thus , beautiful witty, so mewhat talented , as the
comic Operas say, and rich Why, that is happiness , sir ! Why do you

call me unhappy ?
Danglars , seeing his d aughter smiling, and proud even to insolence
could not entirely repress his brutal feelings ; but they betrayed them
selves only by an exclamation U nder the inquiri ng gaze of his d augh
ter, before that beautiful black eyebrow , contracted by interrogation he
prudently t urned away, and calmed himself immediately, daunted by
the iron hand of circumspection
”
Truly, my daughter replied he , with a smile , you are all you
boast of being, excepting one thing ; I will not too hastily tell you
”
which but would rather leave you to guess it
Eug e nie looked at D anglars , much sur prised that one ﬂower of her
crown of pride , with which sh e had so superbly decked herself should
”
be disputed
My daughter , continued the banker, you have per
fe c tly explained to me the sentiments which inﬂuence a girl like you
who is determined sh e will not marry ; now it remains for me to tell
you the motives of a father like me , who has decided his daughter shall

marry
Eug e nie bowed , not as a submissive daughter , but as an adversary
prepared for a discussion

My daughter , continued Danglars , when a father asks his daugh

marry S ome are aff ected with the mania to which you alluded j ust
now, that of living again in their grandchildren This is not my weak

sensations But in that same banker s o ffice , where you very wi ll ingly
presented your s e lf yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I give you
monthly for pocket -money, you must know, my dear young lady, many
things may be learned , useful even to a girl who will not marry There
one may lea r n for instance , what , out of regard to your nervous susc e p
t i bili t y, I wil l inform you of in the drawi ng -roo m, namely, that the credit
of a banker is his physical and moral life ; that credit sustains him as
b r eath a nimates the body ; and M de Monte -Cristo once gave me a lect
ure on that subj ect , which I have never forgotten There we may learn
that as credit sinks , the body becomes a corpse ; and this is what must
happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician

as you for his daughte r

Oh ! cried Eug e nie , you are a bad physiognomist , if you imagine

Have I not my talent left ?
Ca n I not like Pasta , Malibran , Grisi , acquire for myself what you would
never have given me , whatever might have been your fortune a hundred
or a hundred and ﬁfty thousand livres per annum , for which I shall be
indebted to no one but myself ; and which instead of being given , as you
gave me those poor twelve thousand francs with pouting looks and
rep r oaches for my prodigality , will be accompanied with acclamations ,
with b ra ve s, and with ﬂowers ! And if I do not possess that talent ,
which yom smiles prove to me you doubt , should I not still have that
fu ri ous love of independence , which will be a substitute for all treasure ,
and which , in my mind , supersedes even the instinct of self-preserva

aff ecting her ; sh e has taken care for herself , at least I hope so , for her
attention has not been diverted from her proj ects by watching over me ;
sh e has left me my entire independence by professedly indulging my
love for li berty Oh ! no , sir ; from my chil dhood I have seen too
much , and understood too much , of what has passed around me , for
misfortune to have an undue power over me ; from my earliest re col

naturally led me to love no one —so much the better ; now you have my

profession of faith

Then , said Danglars , pale with anger , which did not emanate from
offended paternal love ,
